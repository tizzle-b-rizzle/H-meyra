      BREAKING NEWS! H端meyra, also known as "Tomris", has been awarded the

      commitee, Tyler, for further clarification.

      "It was an easy decision" said Tyler "Tiz" Rooker, whose cat was biting
      his leg "I knew that H端meyra was the greatest teacher of all time since
      our first few letters. She's been so kind in helping me with both grammar
      and individual words and concepts. I really think that OW". Tyler was
      unable to finish due to excessive blood loss in his leg, but we got the
      picture.

      Well, there you have it ladies and gentlemen, H端meyra is legally the
      greatest teacher of all time, and if anyone disagrees, you are legally
      required to sneeze in their face. Stay tuned for tomorrows paper where we
